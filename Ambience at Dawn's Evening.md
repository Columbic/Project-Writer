How might this geologist call,

These fairy small creatures that fill this world to the brim at all?

Small and tiny like a finger,

Always on the lookout for something bigger,

And when he learns their language to a tiny fraction

He can see himself gaining, traction,

The small creatures look with wonder

The magic they exhibit about

Is amazing like the culture throughout

They make no blunders, they make no mistake

He is addicted to these creatures, for love's sake

He won't ask, but he will bask

In the glory of their species task

Simply, to keep peace at last.

The currency that they use like thunderbolt

No, the geologist forgives them for any wrongdoings they might be at fault

Traditions as ancient as Europe.

The morning just ended for them,

The noon and afternoon just the same

Now it's all over again.

The evening is morning, now 7 AM

He learns all about them like the palm of his hand.

He leaves the fairies alone to sleep this say.
