# The Enajdic Concord

This is the living archive of Enajd’s writings—raw, mythic, quasi-sacred.

## What This Is:
A digital vault of stories, prose, and poetic apocalypse. Browse. Read. Recoil.

## Want to Contribute?
You're welcome to help improve the site itself—just don’t touch the sacred texts unless you've been invited. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
